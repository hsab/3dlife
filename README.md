3dlife
======

An implementation of the game of life that operates on Wavefront .OBJ files. The point of this is to simulate reaction diffusion in morphogenesis and attempt to make a (more-or-less) educated guess at what sort of markings people would have if we were marked like, say, tigers. The practical applications are limiteless! Limitless, I say!
